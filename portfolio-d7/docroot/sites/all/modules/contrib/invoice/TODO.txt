TODO
==============================

MUST:
* Make PDF format "A4, letter, etc." configurable

NICE:
* Sorting of invoice items with DRAG and DROP => http://api.drupal.org/api/function/drupal_add_tabledrag
* Make invoice list sortable on customer company name / lastname, firstname
* Filter: Pay status filter in invoice list
* Filter: Overtime status
* Generate invoice only once and output it to a PDF file for better performance and reduce of CPU
  - Display in the invoice list a regenerate invoice icon
* Selectbox in the invoice admin screen with yes/no for displaying the field to manual fillin an invoice number
* Tag an invoice item VAT

VERY NICE:
* Possibility to create a new invoice based on a old one => http://drupal.org/node/345636
* Possibility to link an invoice to a site user + page for that user to view his invoices => http://drupal.org/node/346516
  - With a extra option to also send the invoice by email (if no site user is selected the customer email field that is not implemented yet
    will be choosen, if both are empty an error will be thrown if this checkbox is still checked. => http://drupal.org/node/346005
* Dynamicly extend customer/invoice fields to add for example supplier_kpp_number and supplier_inn_number. A bit like the webforms module idea.
* After invoice item delete set odd/even rows again
* Sending reminders, when exceeding pay limit
* Print "COPY" image on the invoice, for administration archive purposes
