1) Make sure that HTTPS is working on your site before installing this module.
   You can lock yourself out of your site if you don't know what you are doing.
   If you do lock yourself out, see the notes below.

2) Download the module and place the session443 folder into your site's
   sites/all/modules folder.

3) Enable the module at admin/settings/modules.

Notes:

 * If you happen to lock yourself out of your site with this module, install the
   drush module: http://drupal.org/project/drush. Then execute the following
   command from a shell on your server:

   drush disable session443

   Regardless of whether you are having problems or not, if you don't have drush
   installed, get it. You'll be glad you did.
