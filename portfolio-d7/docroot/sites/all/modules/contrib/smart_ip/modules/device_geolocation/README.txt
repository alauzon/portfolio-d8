Description:
Provides visitor's geographical location using client device location source 
that implements W3C Geolocation API (with Google Gears as fallback) whereas 
the coordinates are geocoded using Google Geocoding service. Google Geocoding 
returns a more detailed location information such as: street number, postal code, 
route, neighborhood, locality, sublocality, establishment, administrative area level 1, 
administrative area level 2, etc. 

Smart IP is the last fallback if W3C Geolocation API or Google Gears failed. Even 
if the visitors refuses to share their location, the geographical information provided 
by Smart IP will be used to know your visitors' geolocation details. A themeable Block 
content is available to show your visitor's geolocation information. Device Geolocation 
merges its location data (collected at Google Geocoding service) with Smart IP visitor's 
location data storage which is in session variable ($_SESSION) with array key 'smart_ip' 
and Drupal $user->data object with array key 'geoip_location'.
